				<p>When teaching mathematics, I'm regularly struck by how ingrained quantitative skills are yet how undeveloped they can remain. For example, many of my students often struggle with marginal analysis  (even while mastering differentiation). But each one could intuitively calculate a break-even price point and quantity. My role as a teacher is to help students uncover their own implicit abilities and then to empower them and to challenge them to apply those skills in increasingly diverse ways. There are, of course, subjects that must be introduced and elucidated, and one key is conveying concepts in an affable manner. In some sense, my role is to alleviate the intimidation many face when learning quantitative subjects. More broadly, I help to unearth the individuals whom Maya Angelou once described as ``waiting to happen."</p>
				
				<p>Meaningful study requires rigor. However, rigor is only beneficial if it is complemented by aid, whereby mistakes and misunderstandings can be corrected---to become poignant teaching points rather than penalties.  My students would agree: Over 82 percent described my course as either ``challenging" or ``very challenging" in course evaluations, but nearly 88 percent considered my exams ``fair" or ``very fair." For these reasons, I reject the notion that students are analogous to customers who must be  served and are always right (as the saying goes). They are capable of profound work and reflection---but only when I succeed in my teaching capacity, simultaneously stretching their perspectives while supporting their efforts.</p>

				<p>One notable advantage of teaching while in graduate school was the immediate insight I gained into student perspectives: What is pedagogically appealing? What is frustrating? What inhibits the learning process for a student, and what catalyzes it? It cemented my teaching philosophy: abandon power point presentations (unless absolutely necessary) and textbook references; embrace  online homework modules with accessible and limitless examples; liberally share as many secondary sources as necessary, including YouTube videos and old exams, rather than stifling the free flow of information; give take-home exams, favoring multi-faceted and thoughtful questions promoting deeper contemplation rather than rote and rushed problems; respond to student emails on the same day; and always schedule to meet (during office hours or outside of them) with students as soon as possible. My dual existence as student and lecturer also guaranteed that I treat my students with the respect, patience, and maturity they deserve.</p>
				
				<p>Teaching at Brooklyn College (a senior college within the City University of New York) was particularly inspiring because of the diverse student body engaged in a liberal education. Each semester my top students were of a different age, gender, race, and religion. It crystalized my belief that a university education should be achievable to anyone, and financial support should be made available to position students for success. (Too many of my students struggled under the financial burdens of full-time jobs and supporting families at home.)</p>
				
				<p>Teaching is a skill I will always practice and improve. As a nervous graduate student, I constantly learned  about teaching from my students with each additional lecture, exam, and office hour, and incremental gains were evident. While more than three-quarters of my former students, across all semesters, were ``somewhat" or ``very likely" to recommend me as an instructor, by my last semester more than 92 percent of students were likely to recommend me. That one-third of my former students believed they did not gain either a ``fair amount" or ``a lot" in their ability to ``analyze and solve" problems, however, remains tremendous motivation to continually improve.</p>
				
				<p>To summarize my perspective on university pedagogy, I agree with Anne Hall that a college education is for ``developing the muscle of thoughtfulness."  My role is to train and inspire that muscle such that students acquire the tools to be able to influence rather than be influenced, to perceive themselves in a wider world, and to imagine a more just future.</p>
