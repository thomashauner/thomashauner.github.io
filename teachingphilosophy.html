				<p>In teaching mathematics, I'm regularly struck by how universal quantitative skills are for students yet how nebulous they can remain. For example, some of my business students majoring in marketing or business administration often struggle with fractions and decimals. But every single student could immediately answer how many quarters or dimes there are in one dollar. I believe my role as a teacher is to help students uncover their own implicit abilities---quantitative, and elementary, in this example---and then empower them and challenge them to apply those skills in increasingly diverse ways.</p>
				
				<p>I also believe that meaningful study requires rigor. However, rigor is only beneficial if it is complemented by aid, whereby mistakes and misunderstandings can be corrected---to become poignant teaching points rather then penalties.  My students would agree: over 82 percent described my course as either ``challenging" or ``very challenging" in course evaluations but nearly 88 percent considered my exams ``fair" or ``very fair." For these reasons I also reject the notion that students are analogous to customers who must be coddled, served, and are always right. They are capable of profound work and reflection, but only when simultaneously stretched and supported. </p>

				<p>One advantage of teaching as a graduate student was the immediate perspective it shed on: what is appealing as a student; what frustrates me; what inhibits the learning process for a student and what catalyzes it. This led me to abandon power point presentations (unless absolutely necessary) and abandon textbook references. It led me to embrace online homework modules with immediate feedback tools, and share as many secondary sources as necessary, including videos, lectures, and old exams, rather than stifling the free flow of information. It prompted me to give take-home exams, with multi-faceted and thoughtful questions. It forced me to respond to all my students' emails on the same day and always schedule office hours with them as soon as possible. It guaranteed that I treat my students with the respect, patience, and maturity they deserve, while maintaining honesty about my own abilities.</p>
				
				<p>Teaching, like my research, is a skill I will continually practice. While more than three-quarters of my former students were ``somewhat" or ``very likely" to recommend me as an instructor, as a nervous graduate student I learned a tremendous amount from my students about teaching with each additional lecture, homework, and exam. By my last three semesters more than 83 percent of students were likely to recommend me. That only two-thirds of my former students believed they had gained either a ``fair amount" or ``a lot" in their ability to ``analyze and solve" problems, however, remains a tremendous motivation to always find improvements in my teaching.</p>
				
				<p>To conclude, I cite professor Anne Hall's perspective on university pedagogy as a simple but unifying principle. A college education ``is for developing the muscle of thoughtfulness," whether it be applied towards engaging in intellectual life, making informed civic choices, or solving a personal or professional problem. </p>
