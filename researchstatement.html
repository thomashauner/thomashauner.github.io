			<p>James Tobin once said the most important decision a scholar makes is what problems to work on. My line of inquiry focusses on the economic and social effects of inequality. These effects may include macroeconomic phenomena, such as financial market stability and GDP growth, or social phenomena, such as civil conflicts and militarization, or a synthesis of the two, like technological innovation. My research thus operates at a crossroads of many economic disciplines, including macroeconomics, finance, international economics, applied econometrics, development, political economy, and economic history. It also invites collaboration with interdisciplinary scholars (e.g. computer scientists, linguists, historians, sociologists). Methodological approaches are not limited to applied econometric analyses, but include theoretical modeling and qualitative historical perspectives. </p>
			
			<p>With the increasing availability of detailed inequality data, my research creates a new field examining the consequences from changing inequality while simultaneously bridging economic fields and bringing together interdisciplinary researchers. The list below provides brief descriptions of completed research projects and ongoing work. </p>

				<LI><p> <em>"A Network Model of Wealth Inequality and Financial Instability."</em> [Job market paper] </p>
					<p>How does an economy's distribution of financial assets impact its stability in the event of a shock? The question is approached from a graph theory perspective whereby financial assets link individuals to form a network. Its topology varies with the level of wealth inequality and total wealth. Both jointly determine network stability in the event of a negative income shock, as simulation results demonstrate. These results are empirically confirmed with long-run panel data for nine countries, showing increasing wealth inequality, in an economy with high levels of aggregate wealth, significantly increases the likelihood of financial crises---particularly stock market crashes. To my knowledge it is the first paper to merge financial network contagion modeling with questions of interpersonal distributions. It thus presents significant research opportunities for the near and long-term, with augmented and increasingly complicated modeling of individual and, eventually, firm behavior. </p>
					
				<LI><p> <em>"Application of Social Network Analysis in the Estimation of Bank Financial Strength During the Financial Crisis"</em> with Morales, M., Brizan, D., Ghaly, H., Ma, M., Reza, S. and A. Rosenberg. (April 2014). <i>NLP Unshared Task in PoliInformatics 2014.</i></p>	
					<p>This paper, co-authored with several computational linguistics and computer science PhD students, also explores network formation, but empirically. We study the possibility of using a bankâ€™s social relations to estimate its financial strength during the financial crisis of 2007--2008, applying Natural Language Processing techniques to a corpus of financial and legislative data. The initial result is a social network map of primary actors in the financial crisis, with opportunities for further research on social networks and spatial econometric applications. </p>

				<LI><p> <em>"Instability, Credit, and Inequality in the United States Since 1913."</em> [Dissertation essay] </p>
					<p>Another methodological application of the CVAR model, this paper tests multiple hypotheses concerning long-run relationships between inequality, credit, and financial instability. The central role of abnormal credit growth in financial crises is well defined, thus we test if this relationship holds statistically, and then expand the model to test if either income or wealth inequality is also a long-run determinant of credit growth or financial instability. </p>
